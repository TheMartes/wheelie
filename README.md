# Wheelie - your best k8s friend

## About this project
This is early stage alpha release. It counts with your local k8's config in `$HOME/.kube/config. Currently all functionality although *it works on my machine* is purely experimental so you can encounter bugs quite often. If you do so, please report them, ideally with screenshot of console tab in dev tools. Thanks ❤️

## Contributing
Currently freestyle but please discuss if u want to add new features.
